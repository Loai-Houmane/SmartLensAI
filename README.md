# 🤖 AI Flutter Application

Welcome to my AI Flutter Application, a cutting-edge mobile app designed to showcase multiple artificial intelligence capabilities within a single, user-friendly interface. This application leverages Flutter, Google's UI toolkit, for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. My app features several AI functionalities, including digit recognition, object detection, and real-time detection, making it a versatile tool for users interested in AI technologies.

## ✨ Features

- **🔢 Digit Recognition**: Utilizes a trained model to accurately recognize digits from images or real-time camera feeds.
- **🕵️ Object Detection**: Capable of identifying and labeling objects within a static image or through the camera in real-time.
- **⚡ Real-Time Detection**: Offers the ability to detect and classify objects or digits in real-time, providing instant feedback to the user.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the AI Flutter Application, ensure you have Flutter 2.2.3 installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

1. 📥 Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. 🖥️ Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. 📦 Run `flutter pub get` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. 📱 Launch an emulator or connect a physical device.
5. ▶️ Run `flutter run` to start the application.

## 📚 Dependencies

- **Flutter**: For building the application's UI and logic.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: Used for integrating AI models into the application.
- **Camera**: To access real-time camera feeds for detection.

## 🧠 Models

The application includes the following pre-trained TensorFlow Lite models:

- **Digit Recognition**: `converted_mnist_model.tflite`
- **Object Detection**: `a.tflite` (Placeholder name, replace with the actual model name)

These models are located in the `assets` directory and are automatically loaded by the application at runtime.
